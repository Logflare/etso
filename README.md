# Etso

## Overview

Etso is an [ETS](http://erlang.org/doc/man/ets.html) adapter, allowing you to use [Ecto](https://hexdocs.pm/ecto/Ecto.html) schemas with ETS tables.

Within this library, a bare-bones Ecto Adapter is provided. The Adapter transparently spins up ETS tables for each Ecto Repo and Schema combination. The tables are publicly accessible to enable concurrency, and tracked by reference to ensure encapsulation. Each ETS table is spun up by a dedicated Table Server under a shared Dynamic Supervisor.

For a detailed look as to what is available, check out [Northwind Repo Test](https://github.com/evadne/etso/tree/master/test/northwind/repo_test.exs).

## Highlights & Benefits

Key highlights of this library are:

- It transparently handles translations between `Ecto.Schema` structs and ETS tuples.
- It knows how to form ETS Match Specifications for simple queries.

Key points to consider when adopting this library are:

- It is suitable for rapid retrieval of simply formatted data, for example presets that do not change frequently.
- It is not suitable for use as a full-fledged data layer unless your requirements are simple.

## Feature Coverage

The following features are working:

- Basic query scenarios (C / R / U / D): insert all, insert one, get by ID, where, delete by ID.
- Selects
- Assocs
- Preloads

The following features, for example, are missing:

- Aggregates (dynamic / static)
- Joins
- Windows
- Transactions
- Migrations
- Locking

## Installation

Using Etso is a two-step process. First, include it in your applicationâ€™s dependencies:

    defp deps do
      [
        {:etso, "~> 0.1.0"}
      ]
    end

Afterwards, create a new [Ecto.Repo](https://hexdocs.pm/ecto/Ecto.Repo.html), which uses `Etso.Adapter`:

    defmodule MyApp.Repo do
      @otp_app Mix.Project.config()[:app]
      use Ecto.Repo, otp_app: @otp_app, adapter: Etso.Adapter
    end

Once this is done, you can use any struct against the Repo normally, as you would with any other Repo. Check out the [Northwind modules](https://github.com/evadne/etso/tree/master/test/support/northwind) for an example.
